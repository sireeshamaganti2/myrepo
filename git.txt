Version Controlling
=======================
This is the process of maintianing multiple versions of the code
All the team members uplaod their code(check in) into the remote
version controlling system.The VCS accepts the code uplaods from 
multiple team members and integrates it so that when the other
team members download the code they will be able to see the entire
work donw by the team

VCS's also preserve older and later versions of the code so that
at any time we can switch between which ever version we want

VCS's also keep a track of who is making what kind of changes
